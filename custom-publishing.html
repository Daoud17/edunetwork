        <p class="pub-paragraph">
          Shifting Narratives was our second edition for the AUB Academic Reader
          and AUB’s fourth. In Shifting Narratives readers encounter a wide
          variety of texts written for a range of academic and popular
          audiences, which together raise questions about what it means to be an
          active participant in the world.

        <p class="pub-paragraph">
          Readers are prompted to re-consider questions of how they engage with
          their society and represent it. The texts encourage readers to
          re-examine their deepest convictions about what it means to be here
          and now, possibly helping to shift the narratives that define their
          rapidly evolving lives.
